Hi! I am `Daniel`, a (double) second-year PhD student at the [ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ University of Milano - Bicocca](https://en.unimib.it/) and the [ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡± University of Groningen](https://rug.nl/) working on interpretability, fairness and security of generative (and non-generative) Large Language Models. My supervisors are [Elisabetta Fersini](https://www.unimib.it/elisabetta-fersini) and [Malvina Nissim](https://www.rug.nl/staff/m.nissim/?lang=en).

My research focuses on the use of interpretability as a tool to make generative models safer, more reliable and less toxic to extend and improve their real-world applications.

In my spare time I [take pictures](https://www.instagram.com/daniel_sc4) and [`echo "from NL import infrastructure" > Milan.py`](https://www.instagram.com/pensamiciclabile/).
